# pixieDust
This toolbox works by applying a given style to matlab figures. 
The idea is to be able to produce publication-ready figures directly in Matlab, or with minimal post-editing.
Styles can be exported from existing figures, saved, and edited by hand in a text file. 
Then they can be applied to a figure by running the command pixieDust.
A temporary matlab figure file is automatically created and an eps file saved upon running the command. 
Plots can also be combined in multiple-panel figures with the pixiePanel function.
